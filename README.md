# Applied Linear Algebra: Group Project
This is our code for the MATH3300 (Applied Linear Algebra) group project, ensuring results are reproducible by anyone.

Our submitted paper only contained a snippet of our code, to review it entirely you can read through the `main.py` file. The file `config.py` contains the problem constraints mentioned in the paper. The `dataset` directory also contains our CSV file for the dataset we built.

# Instructions to Reproduce Results
1. Install the dependencies by executing this command: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the Python script by executing this command: `python3 main.py`
